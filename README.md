## Nº 02 Basic Web Pages

This chapter introduced me to raw HTML structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Basic Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Basics of HTML</h1>
        <p>How use tags, create lists, 
        inline elements and more.</p>
    </body>
</html>

```
## Nº 03 Links & Images

1. Learned how create and manipulate links:
```html

```
2. Also learned about the most common image formats:
```html
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg"/>

     <h2>GIFs</h2>
     <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
     <img src="images/mochi.gif"/>

     <h2>PNGs</h2>
     <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
     <img src="images/mochi.png"/>

     <h2>SVGs</h2>
     <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
     <img src="images/mochi.svg"/>
```
## Nº 04 Hello, CSS

Introduction to CSS basics, styling headings and lists. 
>On my own, I went further and started playing with pseudo-classes (like: root) and also tried different styles of links.

## Nº 05 Box Model
In this chapter, i dove deep to box model concepts.
* ***Everything is a box.***
* Boxes can be inline or block-level.
* Boxes have content, padding, borders, and margins.
* They also have seemingly arbitrary rules about how they interact.

## Nº 07 Floats
I learned in here how to deal with horizontal alignment and had fun creating a magazine layout. I released that ***floats are good but also limited*** nowadays because now we have flexbox.
This chapter is awesome and very solid, perfect for beginners. Reference <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/floats/" target="_blank"> here </a>.

## Nº 08 Flexbox
Yay! Finally, Flexbox Chapter. One of the best tutorials I ever seen on Internet, easy and very detailed. I feel confident to create layouts now. 
##### Flexbox Tips:
* Use `display: flex;` to create a flex container.
* Use `justify-content` to define the horizontal alignment of items.
* Use `align-items` to define the vertical alignment of items.
* Use `flex-direction` if you need columns instead of rows.
* Use the `row-reverse` or column-reverse values to flip item order.
* Use `order` to customize the order of individual elements.
* Use `align-self` to vertically align individual items.
* Use `flex` to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.
