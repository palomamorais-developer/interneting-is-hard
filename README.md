## NÂº 05 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/" target="_blank">Box Model</a>
âœ³ In this chapter, i dove deep to box model concepts.
* ***Everything is a box.*** ðŸ“¦
* Boxes can be **inline** or **block-level**.
* Boxes have content, **padding**, **borders**, and **margins**.
* They also have seemingly arbitrary rules about how they interact.


## NÂº 06 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-selectors/" target="_blank">Selectors</a>
âœ…I  learned how to properly use **classes**, **pseudo-classes** and **ids** and implement in many ways. 


## NÂº 07 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/floats/" target="_blank">Floats</a>
âœ…  Learned how deal with horizontal alignment and had fun creating a magazine layout. I released that ***floats are good but also limited***  ðŸ˜…. 


## NÂº 08 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>
âœ³ Yay! Finally, Flexbox Chapter. One of the best tutorials I ever seen on Internet, easy and very detailed. Now I feel confident to create layouts. ;) 

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips:** 
* Use `display: flex;` to create a flex container.
* Use `justify-content` to define the horizontal alignment of items.
* Use `align-items` to define the vertical alignment of items.
* Use `flex-direction` if you need columns instead of rows.
* Use the `row-reverse` or column-reverse values to flip item order.
* Use `order` to customize the order of individual elements.
* Use `align-self` to vertically align individual items.
* Use `flex` to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.


## NÂº 09 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/" target="_blank">Advanced Positioning</a>
âœ³ Change a element without mess the layout is really powerfull. This chapter introduced me to **relative** ,**absolute**, ***relatively absolute*** and **fixed** and as exercise we made a drop-down menu(*not responsive yet!*) wrapping all this techniques learned.

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips:** 
* `position:relative` - tweak the position of an element without affecting its surrounding boxes.
* `position:absolute` - take elements out of the static flow of the page and place them relative to the browser window.

* `position:fixed` - let us make elements that don't scroll with the rest of the page.

* *Relatively Absolute* (`position:relative` on parent -> `position:absolute` on child) - allow us to hook back into the static flow of the page.
