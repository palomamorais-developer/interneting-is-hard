## NÂº 01 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/">Introduction</a>

## NÂº 02 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/basic-web-pages/">Basic Web Pages</a>

âœ³ This chapter introduced me to raw HTML structure (*that I'm  already totally familiar with it, but extra knowledge never hurts* ðŸ˜Š ).
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Basic Web Page</title>

1. âœ…How create and manipulate links:
```html
<a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/">Interneting Is Hard</a>
```
2. ðŸ’¡ Most common image formats:
```html
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg"/>

     <h2>GIFs</h2>
     <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
     <img src="images/mochi.gif"/>

     <img src="images/mochi.svg"/>
```

## NÂº 04 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/">Hello,CSS</a>
âœ³ **Introduction to CSS** basics, styling headings and lists.( *Again, just learning some extras here.*)
>On my own, I went further and started playing with **pseudo-classes** (like: root) and also tried give some *minimalist* effect to links.ðŸ˜…


## NÂº 05 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/">Box Model</a>
âœ³ In this chapter, i dove deep to box model concepts.
* ***Everything is a box.*** ðŸ“¦
* Boxes can be **inline** or **block-level**.
* Boxes have content, **padding**, **borders**, and **margins**.
* They also have seemingly arbitrary rules about how they interact.


## NÂº 06 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-selectors/">Selectors</a>
âœ…I  learned how to properly use **classes**, **pseudo-classes** and **ids** and implement in many ways. 


## NÂº 07 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/floats/">Floats</a>
âœ…  Learned how deal with horizontal alignment and had fun creating a magazine layout. I released that ***floats are good but also limited***  ðŸ˜…. 


## NÂº 08 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/">Flexbox</a>
âœ³ Yay! Finally, Flexbox Chapter. One of the best tutorials I ever seen on Internet, easy and very detailed. Now I feel confident to create layouts. ;) 

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips:** 
* Use `display: flex;` to create a flex container.
* Use `justify-content` to define the horizontal alignment of items.
* Use `align-items` to define the vertical alignment of items.
* Use `flex-direction` if you need columns instead of rows.
* Use the `row-reverse` or column-reverse values to flip item order.
* Use `order` to customize the order of individual elements.
* Use `align-self` to vertically align individual items.
* Use `flex` to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.


## NÂº 09 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/" >Advanced Positioning</a>
âœ³ Change a element without mess the layout is really powerfull. This chapter introduced me to **relative** ,**absolute**, ***relatively absolute*** and **fixed** and as exercise we made a drop-down menu(*not responsive yet!*) wrapping all this techniques learned.

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips:** 
* `position:relative` - tweak the position of an element without affecting its surrounding boxes.
* `position:absolute` - take elements out of the static flow of the page and place them relative to the browser window.

* `position:fixed` - let us make elements that don't scroll with the rest of the page.

* *Relatively Absolute* (`position:relative` on parent -> `position:absolute` on child) - allow us to hook back into the static flow of the page. 

## NÂº 10 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/">Responsive Design</a>
âœ³During this chapter, I learned about *important* concepts of r**esponsive design,** such as:
* Difference between **fluid layouts** and **fixed-width layouts**.
* How use **media queries** to create layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop.
* How create a ***mobile first*** stylesheet.

##  NÂº 11 <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-images/">Responsive Images</a>

âœ³ Making a image responsive is way more complicated than just making a responsive design,  but using the right methods, the results can be very good. 

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips:**

1. **Retina Optimization**:

    Using `srcset` to optimize for screen resolution.

  >*Great for images less than 600 pixels wide because they arenâ€™t big enough to benefit from the second scenario.* 
```html

        <img src='illustration-small.png'
             srcset='images/illustration-small.png 1x,
                     images/illustration-big.png 2x'
             style='max-width: 500px' />

```

2. **Screen Width Optimization**:

    Using `srcset` plus `sizes` to optimize for device width.

>*This method gives a very important optimization for larger images, especially full-bleed photos.* 

```html

        <img src='images/photo-small.jpg'
             srcset='images/photo-big.jpg 2000w,
                     images/photo-small.jpg 1000w'
             sizes='(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw' />

```
3. **Art Direction** using `<picture>`:

    Using the `<picture>` element for manual control over which image file is displayed.
  >*Think of art direction as responsive image optimization for designers.*
    


 ```html

        <picture>
            <source media='(min-width: 401px)'
                    srcset='images/photo-big.jpg'/>
            <source media='(max-width: 400px)'
                    srcset='images/photo-tall.jpg'/>
            <img src='images/photo-small.jpg'/>
        </picture>
           
 ```
